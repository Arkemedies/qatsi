				What sets us apart from most App development firms, is that we offer what they too often can not. What I am referring to is Web Architecture. When designing and engineering web application software, it's crucial that the developer has the "right-kind-of-experience" to back the quality of development necessary to create an efficient, and functional app for every platform of usability  across the client's app.
