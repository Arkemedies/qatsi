App-based Marketing for Small Businesses

Hi, I'm Jasper and I make mobile apps for small businesses and entrepreneurs. 

Why, build an app for your business? Let me explain.

An app is like a virtual business card that combines your website with your social media.

If your're like most business owners. you've invested time and money in your marketing.

An app is like putting your business into your client's pockets.

If you already produce a Newsletter or Magazine we can turn that into an app to get people attention for you and your business.

If you produce a magazine, I can even turn that into an app.

iPhone, Android, Ubuntu or Windows, it doesn't matter. We can make the apps to reach all of your clients.
